# Hackers & Painters
*Big Ideas from the Computer Age*<br>
by Paul Graham, 2004

PG explores the intellectual wild west of computers being ingrained into every aspect of our lives.

## Preface

- "This book is an attempt to explain to the world at large what goes on in the world of computers."
- "You may have noticed that a lot of the people getting rich in the last thirty years have been programmers."
- "The money in software is one instance of a more general trend, and that trend is the theme of this book. This is the Computer Age."
- "Everything around us is turning into computers."
- "And since the purpose of this book is to explain how things really are in our world, I decided it was worth the risk to use the words we use."
- "Computer programs are all just text. And the language you choose determines what you can say. Programming languages are what programmers think in."
- "Programmers tend to be divided into tribes by the languages they use."
- "Why do hackers care so much about free speech? Partly, I think, because innovation is so important in software, and innovation and heresy are practically the same thing. Good hackers develop a habit of questioning everything."
- "The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, where you can think anything you want, if you're willing to risk the consequences."
- "Though hackers generally look dull on the outside, the insides of their heads are surprisingly interesting places."
- Chapters are independent

## 6. How to Make Wealth

- starting / joining a startup is the best way to get rich
- "The word "startup" dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages."
- "A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem."
- "Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles."

### The Proposition

- startups compress your working life into less years by working more intensely than in a corporate job
- he accumulates factors to arrive at a ~36x productivity multiplier in a startup (e.g., work more hours, focus more, remove unnecessary management, how much smarter you are than what your current job requires, etc.)
- re: interruptions in startups
	- "One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is uninterruptability."
	- "The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night)."
- "Combine all these multipliers, and I'm claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate job. If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year."
- re: making pay less average
	- "Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate."
- "Startups are not magic. They don't change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain."

### Millions, not Billions

- "It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers."
- "There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery."
- "the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS"
- "Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly."
- "This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it."

### Money Is Not Wealth

- "Wealth is not the same thing as money."
- "Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money."
- "Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can't make for yourself."
- "The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process."
- "The intermediate stuff—the medium of exchange—can be anything that's rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn't physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government."
- "People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage—just a shorthand—for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want."
- re: giving people what they want, not what you like
	- "When you're starting a business, it's easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an "outdoor portal." You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks."
	- "What's the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing."

### The Pie Fallacy

- "A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world."
- "This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy."
- "You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history."
- "In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven't made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie."

### Craftsmen

- "The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen."
- "A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth."
- "Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want."
- "And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something that's made, rather than being distributed"
- "It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs)."
- "Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created."
- "Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software"

### What a Job Is

- "After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing."
- "When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution."
- "What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth."
- "If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth."
- "But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people's."
- "Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It's doing something people want that matters, not joining the group."
- re: going from school to a job
	- "Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college."

### Working Harder

- "That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work."
- "It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work."
- "Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work."
- "Salesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're usually paid a percentage of it."
- "There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured."
- "The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the company does badly, he's done badly."
- "A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors."
- "Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees' work is tangled together."
- "If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people's. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable—and the rest of the group slows you down."

### Measurement and Leverage

- "To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect."
- "An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop."
- "CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They're measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance."
- "I think every one who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage."
- "A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss."
- "If you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage."

### Smallness = Measurement

- "One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company."
- "Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much."
- "It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that yours is going to be averaged with."
- "individual rowers don't see any result from working harder"
- "But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers."
- "startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation)"
- "A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you."
- "Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees. I agree."
- "small in the sense of an all-star team"

### Technology = Leverage

- "Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they're small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology."
- "What is technology? It's technique. It's the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it."
- "If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology."
- "The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that's valuable today could be worthless in a couple years."
- "Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention."
- "Big companies can develop technology. They just can't do it quickly."
- "So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing"
- "It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don't seem to be about technology. McDonald's, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store."
- "Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way."
- "What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we'd always take the harder one."
- "We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can't follow."
- "something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors"
- "Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry. If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he'll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to develop?"
- "Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they'll take away your market overnight."
- "patents"
- "And if they can't, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it's an everyday thing for them. They'll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time."
- re: companies that invent things vs. make money from things
	- "Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know the "inventor" of something ... it is because their company made money from it, and the company's PR people worked hard to spread the story."
- "Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice."
- re: taking the harder path
	- "This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder."
	- "You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it."

### The Catch(es)

- "If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup."
- "When you're running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can."
- "The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity."
- "A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score."
- "all-or-nothing proposition"
- "Via web came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave."
- "Via web's hackers were all extremely risk-averse."
- "We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal."
- "The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff."
- "It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative"
- "They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one."

### Get Users
- "I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It's also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify."
- "How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company."
- "Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act."
- "The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor."
- "In both cases, what it all comes down to is users."
- "In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you've created wealth."
- "Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you're not just trying to solve problems. You're trying to solve problems that users care about."
- "Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement."
- "Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly—taking a long time to develop a product."
- "Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you're optimizing based on guesses."
- "you have to know what people want"
- "You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate."

### Wealth and Power

- "Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common."
- "Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world's history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it."
- "So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money."
- "the second big change, industrialization"
- "Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt."
- "Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly."
- "The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It's that it tends not to happen at all."
- "Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs."
- "Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today."
- "the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it"
- "The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world."
