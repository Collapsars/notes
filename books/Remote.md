## <a name="pre1"></a>Authors' Note

- remote work has been on the rise since 2005, though it wasn't recently put in the spotlight when Marissa Meyer removed Yahoo's remote-work program
- interestingly, every excuse in [*Dealing with Excuses*](#ch2) got airtime during this

## <a name="pre2"></a>Introduction
- remote work is seeing increased adoption & the tech to collaborate remotely is here now
- this book aims to be the missing piece: upgrade the human mind so workers embrace freedom & productivity benefits and companies increased their access to talent (and everyone learns how to overcome the downsides)
- freedom in location is the new luxury

## <a name="ch1"></a>1. The Time is Right for Remote Work

### Why work doesn't happen at work
- modern offices have become *interruption factories*
- meaningful work requires stretches of uninterrupted time to get in the zone
- which is hard when your day is chopped up by meetings / unnecessary interruptions
- yes, working remotely brings new interruptions, but they're *passive* & under your control

### Stop commuting your life away
- commuting increases your risk of obesity, nick pain, and stress
- imagine what you could accomplish if you reclaim all of that commuting time?
- for example, they built Basecamp's MVP in 400 dev hours ~= the amount of time you might spend commuting in a year

### It's the technology, stupid
- past generations have been conditioned to think work happens from 9-5 in an office
- the tech to do realtime chat, file sharing, and collaboration have caught up, but we have to embrace it

### Escaping 9am-5pm
- synchronous --> **asynchronous collaboration**
- being spread across more time zones allows everyone to flex when they work
- with creative work, maybe you don't even need to have a set schedule... if you can't get in the zone, just take time away and come back later
- when working on a new film, film editors at IT Collective go nocturnal overlapping with others just enough to review progress and get direction for the next night
- work > clocked hours

### End of city monopoly
- population-dense cities created talent hubs, but we gave up freedom and fresh air for convenience
- advances that made remote work possible, make remote living more desirable
- entertainment is accessible digitally, improving remote culture
- do you still need to be bound by the small apartment in the city?
- "So here's a prediction: The luxury privilege of the next twenty years will be to leave the city.  Not as its leashed servant in a suburb, but to wherever one wants."

### The new luxury
- old-money luxury (company Lexus, secretary) and new-money luxury (free meals, laundry, massages) come at the opportunity cost of losing time for family & extracurriculars 
- **"The new luxury is freedom & time"**: shed the shackles of *deferred living* to pursue your passions *now*, while you're still working today
- blend work & "retirements" to design a better *lifestyle* overall today, not down the road
- 	also reminds me of Tim Ferriss' *mini retirements*
- location changes don't have to be binary: visit another city for just a few weeks

### Talent isn't bound by the hubs
- **talent hub nationalists** insist magic happens only on their turf
- prediction: the % of great tech made outside of the valley will rise
- great talent is global & not everyone wants to move to SF
- they've observed that employees working outside of industry echo chambers are happier in their work [could be that they compare their work to others less, or that the sample is biased by the personality types 37s attracts]

### It's not about the money
- remote promotes quality of life & gives access to talent in any geography
- intellectual pursuits are the best fit for remote: writing, design, programming, etc.

### But saving is always nice
- the company can also save $
- ex. IBM is 40% remote & had reduced office expenses by billions

### Not all or nothing
- remote work is about setting your team free to live where they want
- the 37s office in Chicago regularly has 10 of their 36 employees, but they consider it a luxury, not a necessity

### Still a trade-off
- sometimes it's better to talk with your manager or having big brainstorming sessions in person
- losing imposed structure requires a higher level of personal commitment to stick with it
- setting boundaries can be hard: kids, spouse, procrastination -- just focus on the benefits while mitigating drawbacks

### You're probably already doing it
- you already have remote workers: legal, accounting, payroll, ...
- so many companies trust *outsiders* to work remotely efficiently, but not *insiders*... that's pretty irrational
- we already do a lot of asynchronous communication with coworkers -- is it really worth coming to the office?
- notice how much work already happens with minimal face-to-face interaction
