	- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/review-the-elements-of-investing/) - An excellent foundation to investing.

Note: I gave the first edition an 80/20 read in August 2013.  As my financial understanding has matured, I'd like to review it and dig deeper.  The updated edition appears mostly to just be the addition of Chapter VI.
