by Randall Stross, 2013

The Launch Pad is an unprecedented look behind the scenes of startup accelerator Y Combinator with its S11 batch.

## Introduction

### Silicon Valley, software startups, and the future

- Silicon Valley's past is accessible through museums and historic garages, but in themselves they aren't that interesting; the real action is in the startups of today
- "There are literally thousands of startups, dispersed along the sixty-mile corridor that extends between San Francisco and San Jose, but they all operate under secrecy until they are ready to launch their first product. That's why there can never be a Gray Line tour of Silicon Valley's future."
- "There are literally thousands of startups, dispersed along the sixty-mile corridor that extends between San Francisco and San Jose, but they all operate under secrecy until they are ready to launch their first product. That's why there can never be a Gray Line tour of Silicon Valley's future."
- "It's a shame, because this place is creating everyone's future."
- "No place in the world has anything approaching the concentration of software startups in Silicon Valley, and this is where, Andreessen says, he expects the majority of future disruptors will appear."
- If it were accessible, YC would be the best place to see software startups in the Valley

### YC and the YC model

- "[Y Combinator] refers to a particular kind of function, for receiving data, performing a calculation, and sending a result back, that most programmers have never used or even understand."
- The YC model (batch investing, three-month residency, Demo Day) was pioneering, beginning with its first batch in Summer 2005 (S05), and copied by dozens of seed funds around the world
- PG wrote the code for HN
- "Applicants to Y Combinator are asked, 'Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.'"
- "YC's principal supplier of capital is Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm whose roster of successful early investments include Apple, Yahoo, and Google."
- YC startups that have done exceptionally well: Dropbox (S07), Airbnb (W09), Heroku (W08)

- "When YC alumni abandon their YC-backed startup to start over with a new idea, some return to YC to go through the program again."

### Randall Stross

- Stross took up residency at YC and observed quietly to come up with something similar to *eBoys: The First Inside Account of Venture Capitalists at Work*, a book he'd written about Benchmark Capital during the dot-com boom
- "This book originally was going to end at Demo Day, but I have extended the time frame far enough to see one batch's founders greet the founders in the next one. All beginnings are full of possibility, and beginning are now mass-produced in Silicon Valley. Here is how."
