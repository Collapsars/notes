## 4. The Ideology of Competition

**PURPOSE**: Why do people think competition is something to love?

### "Competition == good" is a pervasive idea 
- **creative monopoly**: "new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator"
- **competition**: "no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival"
- competition is a pervasive ideology in our society that we preach and internalize even though more competition leaves less for us to gain
- our educational system reflects this by using grades to measure how students compete against each other
- students that get the highest marks receive status & credentials, and every student gets taught the same subjects in the same ways
- "elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them"
- Thiel missed out on being awarded a Supreme Court clerkship -- the highest prize for a law student)
- if he had got it, PayPal probably would have never been created
- MBA students love war analogies, but it's really competition, not business, that's like war
- the key to success is [market dominance](http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/30/why-eric-schmidt-doesnt-know-how-google-works/) (e.g., Google's search monopoly)

### Understanding conflict
- 2 models for understanding conflict
- Marx - difference
- Shakespeare - similarity

### Don't focus too much on your competition
- becoming obsessed with your competition is the Shakespeare model
- this is how Apple surpassed Google + Microsoft in market cap
- Square vs. everyone and their brother making a mobile credit card reader
- people that are less susceptible to social conformity become an advantage in the valley
- competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where they don't exist
- ex. the online pet store market (e.g., Pets.com) was overrun w/ competition obsessed w/ defeating each other -- "everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting"

### Fight or merge
- "If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge"
- Elon Musk started X.com at the same time and with a very similar feature set to Peter Thiel's PayPal, so they merged to prevent focusing on each other too much before the bubble popped
- fighting is binary: "either don't throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly"
