## <a name="ch0"></a>Preface
**PURPOSE**: Why does this book exist?

- learn from what Gates, Zuckerberg, etc. have done; don't just copy them
- copying an existing model takes the world from **1 to n**
- creating something new takes the world from **0 to 1** (what this book is about)
- just fine-tuning today's models leads to a failed future -- innovation is necessary

> "Humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles *technology*."

<!-- -->

> "[T]his book offers no formula for success. The **paradox of teaching entrepreneurship** is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative."

- based on Thiel's Stanford course [CS183](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?page=0&q=CS+183&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&view=catalog&collapse=&academicYear=20112012), and [renowned notes compiled by Blake Masters](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup)

## <a name="ch4"></a>4. The Ideology of Competition
**PURPOSE**: Why do people think competition is something to love?

### "Competition == good" is a pervasive idea 
- **creative monopoly**: "new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator"
- **competition**: "no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival"
- competition is a pervasive ideology in our society that we preach and internalize even though more competition leaves less for us to gain
- our educational system reflects this by using grades to measure how students compete against each other
- students that get the highest marks receive status & credentials, and every student gets taught the same subjects in the same ways
- "elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them"
- Thiel missed out on being awarded a Supreme Court clerkship -- the highest prize for a law student)
- if he had got it, PayPal probably would have never been created
- MBA students love war analogies, but it's really competition, not business, that's like war
- the key to success is [market dominance](http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/30/why-eric-schmidt-doesnt-know-how-google-works/) (e.g., Google's search monopoly)

### Understanding conflict
- 2 models for understanding conflict
- Marx - difference
- Shakespeare - similarity

### Don't focus too much on your competition
- becoming obsessed with your competition is the Shakespeare model
- this is how Apple surpassed Google + Microsoft in market cap
- Square vs. everyone and their brother making a mobile credit card reader
- people that are less susceptible to social conformity become an advantage in the valley
- competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where they don't exist
- ex. the online pet store market (e.g., Pets.com) was overrun w/ competition obsessed w/ defeating each other -- "everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting"

### Fight or merge
- "If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge"
- Elon Musk started X.com at the same time and with a very similar feature set to Peter Thiel's PayPal, so they merged to prevent focusing on each other too much before the bubble popped
- fighting is binary: "either don't throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly"

## <a name="ch5"></a>5. Last Mover Advantage
**PURPOSE**: How does one actually build a monopoly business?

### Future cash flows
- Twitter employs a comparable amount of people to The New York Times, but has 12x its market cap, despite losing money now while NYT made money... because Twitter is expected to generate monopoly profits over the next decade, while a newspaper's time to do so has passed
- "the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future" (with future cash flows being discounted to present worth)
- comparing discounted cash flows shows the stark contrast b/t low-growth businesses, like a newspaper or nightclub, and high-growth startups

### Building valuable things takes time
- tech companies lose money at the beginning because it takes time to build valuable things
- LinkedIn has < $1B revenue and only $21MM net income for 2012, but its $24B market cap is justified by projected future cash flows
- the importance of future profits can be counterintuitive
- you must grow AND endure
  - many entrepreneurs focus too much on short-term growth (e.g., weekly active users, monthly revenue targets)
  - but longterm endurance is harder to measure
  - part of the failure of Zynga and Groupon

> "Will this business still be around a decade from now?"

### Characteristics of a monopoly
- some combination of: proprietary tech, network effects, economies of scale, branding

#### 1. Proprietary technology
- **proprietary tech** makes your productive difficult to replicate
- should be "an order of magnitude better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage"
- easiest way to make something that much better is to invent something completely new
- examples
  - Google's search algorithms return the best results + proprietary tech for short page load times and highly accurate query autocompletion
  - PayPal made buying / selling on eBay significantly better by making payments instant vs. waiting 7-10 days for a check to clear
  - Amazon offered 10x the books of other bookstores
  - iPad brought superior integrated design to the tablet computing space --> tablets went from unusable to useful

#### 2. Network effects
- **network effect**: a product becomes more useful as more people use it
- even with that, you must start and prove valuable to a small market first (i.e., Facebook beginning with just Harvard students)
- "the initial markets are so small that they often don't even appear to be business opportunities at all"

#### 3. Economies of scale
- **economies of scale**: a monopoly biz gets stronger as it gets bigger because fixed costs are spread over more sales
- (this is especially dramatic for software startups)
- service businesses are difficult to monopolize (e.g., a yoga studio only has capacity for so many customers; can't provide value to millions of clients the way software engineers can)

#### 4. Branding
- you can create a strong brand (e.g., Apple)
- imitators copy surface features, but Apple has proprietary tech in hardware and software, and dominates the pricing for the materials it buys
- additionally, it enjoys the network effect of having the best app ecosystem --> devs keep writing and users stay

### Building a monopoly

#### 1. Start small and monopolize
- err on the side of starting with too small of a market so you can dominate
- ex. Paypal first went after eBay's powersellers
- "Any big market is a bad choice... This is why it's always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market."

#### 2. Scaling up
- once you dominate the niche market, expand into related, slightly broader markets
- Amazon
  - Bezo's vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he deliberately started with just books
  - "Amazon became the dominant solution for anyone located far from a bookstore or seeking something unusual."
  - then, they expanded into CDs, videos, software
  - adding categories until eventually becoming the "world's general store"
- eBay
  - started with niche markets like beanie babies and small-time hobbyists
  - learned that auction format doesn't work for commodities

#### 3. Don't disrupt
- disruption used to mean a low-end product at a low price that could overtake incumbents, then become better overtime (for example, what PCs did to mainframe computers)
- **disruption**: "a self-congratulatory buzzword for anything posing as trendy and new"
- when you plan expansion into adjacent markets, you don't want to disrupt; you want to avoid competition as much as possible

### ["Don't be good, be great"](http://genius.com/1942097)
- **first mover advantage**: the first player can capture significant market share before competitors even start
- but this is only a tactic; what really matters is generating future cash flows
- better to be the **last mover**, the one that makes the last great development leading to years / decades of monopoly profits
- dominate a small niche and scale up toward your long-term vision over time
- business success is like chess:

> "You must study the endgame before everything else."

> &mdash; <cite>Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca</cite>

## <a name="ch6"></a>6. You Are Not a Lottery Ticket
**PURPOSE**: How should we approach the future?

### Success: luck or skill?
- what is success?
- Malcolm Gladwell: "a patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages"
- Jeff Bezos: luck + timing + brains
- if success were mostly luck, serial entrepreneurs wouldn't exist
- "Every company starts in unique circumstances, and every company starts only once."

> "Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.... Strong men believe in cause and effect."
> 
> &mdash; <cite>Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite>

- "If you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book?"

### Can you control your future?
- definite vs. uncertain
- indefinite attitudes on the future are a problem in the U.S.
- **indefinite view**: assemble a portfolio of various options to be well rounded (or "many-sided mediocrity")
- **definite view**: be great at one substantial thing; favors firm convictions

### Optimism vs. pessimism

- **indefinite pessimism**: sees the future, but doesn't know what to do, so just reacts to it as it happens (ex. modern Europe)
- **definite pessimism**: recognizes the future can be known, but is bleak (ex. China)
- China grows fast by "relentlessly copy[ing] what has already worked in the West"
- **definite optimism**: future will be better than the present if we plan and work to achieve it (ex. Western world from 1600s --> 1960s)
- "Big plans for the future have become archaic curiousities."
- **indefinite optimism**: future will be better but doesn't know how exactly, so he doesn't plan (ex. U.S. 1982 --> present)
- indefinite optimists work on optimizing existing things instead of building new ones (*"the established path"*)
- TODO: insert paraphrased last paragraph from p69

### Other areas

#### Indefinite finance
- "Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth."
- what to do with exit money? 
- entrepreneurs &rarr; banks &rarr; portfolio of institutional investors &rarr; diversified portfolio of stocks &rarr; companies that try to increase their share price w/ cash flow

#### Indefinite politics
- politicians use modern polling to modify their message to match existing public opinion

#### Indefinite philosophy
- ancient philosophers were pessimistic
- modern philosophers are mostly definite optimistic
- late 20th century are indefinite optimistic (John Rawls, Robert Nozick)
- "Arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future."

#### Indefinite life
- **Eroom's law**: "the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&D has halved every nine years since 1950"
- biotech startups are struggling compared to software startups... because their research involves lots of random guessing

### Is indefinite optimism even possible?
- "How can the future get better if no one plans for it?"
- progress w/o planning is **evolution** (i.e., lean startups, MVPs, iteration, ...)
- "Iteration without a bold plan won't take you from 0 to 1"

### Intelligent design
- "The greatest thing Jobs designed was his business."
- the iPod began the post-PC generation, but most people didn't see it yet
- "A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery... it begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance."

## <a name="ch15"></a>Conclusion: Stagnation or Singularity?
**PURPOSE**: What will we make of the future?

### 4 patterns for future of humanity

1. **recurrent collapse**: neverending cycle of prosperity <-> ruin
2. **plateau**: world will converge to the level of today's rich countries
3. **extinction**: devastating collapse / no survival
4. **takeoff**: we make new tech to make a much better figure (that hockey stick curve --> winner)

<!-- -->

- **the singularity**: accelerating progress leads to new tech so powerful it's beyond our understanding
- Ray Kurzweil predicts it will occur [~2045](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)

> "Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better––to go from 0 to 1.  The essential first step is to think for yourself.  Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future."
