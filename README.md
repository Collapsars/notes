# Notes

A small place to gather thoughts from what I'm learning lately.

> "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."

This repo serves three purposes:

1. a log of what I've read recently
2. a queue of what I want to read in the future
3. an archive of what I've read in the distant past

## Meta

Articles are mostly read, highlighted, and annotated in Instapaper.  Alternatively, I use Safari Books Online or Genius.  On occasion, I'll write summaries in Pinboard, mostly for its support for tagging.  My setup uses Feedly as a content inbox with some automation via IFTTT for the feeds I care about most.  And of course I read Hacker News every day.

I rarely read books cover-to-cover.  A blank spot in my notes indicates a skipped section, while those I plan to read eventually are marked with todos.  Star ratings are recommendations on a 1-5 scale.
