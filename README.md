# Notes

An unassuming place to think about what I'm learning.

> "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."

This project serves three purposes:

1. a log - what I'm reading now
2. a queue - what I want to read in the future
3. an archive - what I've finished reading

## Meta

### Workflow

I read, highlight, and annotate articles mostly on Instapaper.  Alternatively, I use Safari Books Online, Medium, or Genius.  On occasion, I'll write summaries in Pinboard for hashtags.  Feedly is my content inbox with automation via IFTTT for "must read" feeds.  I also skim Hacker News daily.

I recommend two Mac apps for editing Markdown: [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) for writing, and [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) for previewing and reading.

### Misc.

- I rarely read books cover-to-cover.  Blank spots indicate skipped sections.
- Star ratings are recommendations on a 1-5 scale.
