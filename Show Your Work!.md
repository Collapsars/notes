## <a name="ch2"></a>2. Think Process, Not Product

### Take people behind the scenes
- process vs. product
- David Bayles and Ted Orland in *Art and Fear*: keep the messy process personal because people care about finished work
- you can bond with your audience by sharing your work-in-progress, day-to-day process, influence, inspirations, tools
- with openness comes potential vulnerability
- put things out there consistently so your audience can connect and be a part of your creative process
- my public reading log is a start, but I need to make it more accessible

### Become a documentarian of what you do
- astronaut Chris Hadfield wanted people to connect with an astronaut's day-to-day life
- he tweeted and YouTubed his normal daily activities, *but in space*
- there's an art to every work and if you present it *"the right way"*, people will be interested
- you can still share process, even if your work is not easily shared, intangible, etc.
- turn the scrap & residue of your process into something for people to see
- keep a work log notebook, scrapbook; take photos, videos, etc. during your process
- documenting & recording your process makes you realize your progress (and gives you material when you're ready to show)
